(I decided to pay a certain caged princess a visit)
[clear - _ - _]
[sensei - _ - none]
(Knock on the door)
[mika - _ - none]
....Who's there? 
[sensei - _ - none]
(Enter)
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - prison_night - none]
[mika - 00 - none]
......
[mika - 12 - none]
Huh...? Sensei!?
[mika - 02 - none]
What are you doing here...!?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"No one should be alone on a day like this."
[mika - 13 - none]
A day like this...?
[mika - 06 - none]
Oh that's right... today is Valentine's Day isn't it?
[mika - 02 - none]
So you came all the way here just for that? 
[mika - 02 - none]
That's just like you Sensei, a girl might just fall for you.
[mika - 01 - none]
But...
[mika - 00 - none]
......
[mika - 08 - none]
Sorry to disappoint you Sensei, I can't give you chocolate stuck in here.
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I'm not here for chocolates"
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I'm here for you, Mika!"
[mika - 04 - none]
?!
[mika - 15 - none]
My my... what a smooth talker.
[mika - 14 - none]
Well... thanks, Sensei.
[sensei - 00 - none]
"That being said...."
[sensei - 00 - none]
(Pull out the gift)
[mika - 09 - none]
Huh...? Is that....?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I got you a little something instead."
[mika - 09 - none]
Valentine's chocolate....
[mika - 10 - none]
Haha, it's shaped like a cakeroll... Sensei do you enjoy teasing me?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"It was the only way to get it approved"
[mika - 10 - none]
Hahaha! That must be because of Nagi-chan... 
[mika - 15 - none]
Still... thanks... Sensei.
[mika - 15 - none]
That's really sweet of you...
[mika - 23 - none]
But, you know what it means to give chocolate on Valentine's.... don't you...?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"Of course I do, I even made it myself!"
[mika - 11 - none]
!?
[mika - 11 - none]
.....
[mika - 22 - none]
Sensei....
[sensei - 00 - none]
"You're very precious to me Mika."
[mika - 15 - none]
Honestly I wasn't expecting that
[mika - 14 - none]
You got me Sensei...
[mika - 03 - none]
This is.....
[mika - 10 - none]
Haha~ look at me, I can't stop smiling...
[mika - 15 - none]
Sensei, I don't know what I'd do without you...
[mika - 14 - none]
It's really late but... would you mind keeping me company a while?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I'll be here as long as you want."
[mika - 15 - none]
Careful Sensei, I just might keep you forever~!
[mika - 03 - none]
Here... I can at least make some tea.
[mika - 02 - none]
Then we can share that "cakeroll" you got me~
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - black_screen - _]
[none - _ - none]
(Then, Mika and I enjoyed the tea and chocolate together, and spent all night chatting.)
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - prison_night - _]
[mika - 02 - none]
Wait that makes no sense
[mika - 04 - none]
You're telling me you fought a giant snake in the desert?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"It was pretty scary but everyone worked hard"
[mika - 10 - none]
Wow... How do you have a giant snake and still lose, talk about embarrassing
[mika - 15 - none]
Though .... 
[mika - 14 - none]
I don't know if I could handle a giant snake
[mika - 07 - none]
They're kinda icky
[bg - prison_night2 - none]
[mika - 06 - none]
I'd really like to visit the beach when summer comes around...
[mika - 08 - none]
Though... I don't see tha-
[sensei - 00 - none]
"You deserve it, Let's go!"
[mika - 11 - none]
So quick....!
[mika - 14 - none]
Well, Yeah...
[mika - 15 - none]
If possible I'd love to go with you
[mika - 15 - none]
Question is.....
[mika - 03 - none]
What should I wear, Sensei...?
[mika - 02 - none]
Would you prefer a white one piece ? Maybe a black bikini...?
[mika - 10 - none]
Just ki-
[sensei - 00 - none]
"Who needs a swImsuit anyway?"
[mika - 11 - none]
...!? 
[mika - 10 - none]
Gosh sensei, You pervert!!
[bg - prison2_day - none]
[mika - 10 - none]
I couldn't believe someone would wear a blouse with shorts!!
[mika - 05 - none]
It was silly but somehow... I got a little curious.
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I'm sure you could pull that off!"
[mika - 03 - none]
You think so...?
[mika - 15 - none]
Maybe It would Work With some good accessories
[sensei - 00 - none]
"We can go shopping some day, Let's Find some new ones"
[mika - 23 - none]
Oh are you a fashion expert now sensei?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I may not look it but I have a good eye for fashion"
[mika - 10 - none]
No way! I'd love to see your flashy side haha!
[mika - 03 - none]
Let's do that someday
[mika - 02 - none]
Oh damn, it's already morning....
[mika - 03 - none]
I guess we lost track of time!
[mika - 03 - none]
Don't you have Schale duties to attend to?
[sensei - 00 - none]
"Ugh, do I have to....."
[mika - 10 - none]
Don't be a baby Sensei...
[mika - 15 - none]
I'm really happy you spent time with me, but you should get going.
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I'll come see you again another time, wait for me"
[mika - 10 - none]
...Haha~ I'll look forward to it~
[mika - 03 - none]
Now go on, get that bread
[mika - 03 - none]
Oh, and be careful on your way out... 
[mika - 15 - none]
If someone see's you leaving my room early in the morning...
[mika - 10 - none]
They just might get the wrong idea, heh~
[sensei - 00 - none]
"I wouldn't mind"
[mika - 22 - none]
!?.... Geez Sensei, have you no shame?
[mika - 10 - none]
Well.... I guess that's what I love about you
[mika - 15 - none]
Have a great day..... my prince~

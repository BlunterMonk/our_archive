(Mika called me early in the morning to meet her, it sounded pretty urgent.)
[clear - _ - _]
[mika - 07 - move_center]
SEEEEEENSEEEEEEI!!!!!
[mika - 11 - _]
I need your help!!!
[sensei - _ - none]
"What's wrong!?"
[mika - 02 - none]
Well you see.... it's almost time for new years right?
[mika - 00 - none]
I really want to use this chance to show my thanks to Seia-chan!
[mika - 05 - none]
She's done so much for me and I...
[mika - 02 - none]
I feel like I have to do something!
[mika - 03 - none]
She's been so kind to me, even after all I did....
[mika - 14 - none]
And she's been through a lot, I want to make it up to her.
[mika - 02 - none]
And so... I want you to help me throw a new years party!
[sensei - _ - none]
"Naruhodo, that sounds like a great idea"
[mika - 09 - none]
And so I need you to help me gather supplies
[mika - 03 - none]
And most importantly, a gift!
[sensei - _ - none]
"A gift huh, any ideas?"
[mika - 07 - _]
That's the problem...!
[mika - 08 - none]
I have no idea what she could want....
[mika - 06 - none]
I think she likes books... she's always spouting some complicated mumbo jumbo...
[mika - 10 - none]
But who would want books as a gift, that's so boring!
[mika - 05 - none]
Maybe some new clothes?
[mika - 02 - none]
Her sleeves don't fit at all right?
[sensei - _ - none]
"Eh? Isn't that just fashion...?"
[mika - 06 - none]
....hmmmmm
[sensei - _ - none]
"What about a new gun or something?"
[mika - 10 - none]
Hahaha I can't remember the last time I saw her shoot!
[mika - 02 - _]
Come to think of it, what kind of gun does she have anyway....
[mika - 03 - _]
You can do it Sensei!
[mika - 03 - none]
Just think about something a teenage girl would love to have.
[sensei - _ - none]
"....How about we shop around for now?"
[none - _ - none]
[sensei - _ - none]
"Maybe something will pop out?"
[mika - 07 - none]
Stumped already?!
[mika - 05 - none]
Well so am I, so that sounds good to me!!
[mika - 10 - none]
Let'sa gooooo!

[shopkeep - _ - _]
Welcome!!
[shopkeep - _ - _]
Everything is on sale right now! We're also holding a BOGO for couples!!
[sensei - _ - _]
"Hear that, FREE cake!!"
[mika - 10 - _]
Oh please, do you want me to call you "honey" now?
[mika - 03 - _]
We got a mission here Sensei!
[sensei - _ - _]
"Ok ok, uh, would Seia like a cake?"
[mika - 02 - _]
I can't think of a single person in Kivotos that doesn't love cake!
[mika - 03 - _]
Plus they're nice and fresh!!
[mika - 05 - _]
One time we were having tea like usual
[mika - 02 - _]
And she got really excited when I gave her my strawberry cheesecake...
[mika - 03 - _]
It was pretty cute not gonna lie...
[mika - 01 - _]
hmmm.... let's see.....
[mika - 02 - move_left]
Sensei look!
[mika - 03 - _]
This one has little gingerbreadmen on it!
[mika - 10 - _]
I love it! That one's blonde too haha!
[mika - 03 - _]
We should grab this one don't you think?
[sensei - _ - _]
"Why stop there, it's buy one get one!"
[mika - 10 - _]
Sensei don't be a pig, come on let's go!
[shopkeep - _ - _]
Thank you so much!
[shopkeep - _ - _]
Enjoy!! And happy new year!!
[mika - 03 - _]

...hmmm......
[sensei - _ - _]
"...Mika?"
[mika - 05 - _]
We got a nice cute cake but...
[mika - 06 - _]
This doesn't really feel like enough.....
[sensei - _ - _]
"Well let's walk a bit more shall we?"
[mika - 03 - _]
Yeah....
[mika - 07 - _]
Sheesh! it's so freaking cold!
[sensei - _ - _]
"Here, stay close to me, we can share my coat"
[mika - 02 - _]
Thanks Sensei...
[mika - 03 - _]
You're like a walking heater, why are you so warm?!
[sensei - _ - _]
"Uhh... y'know... physics..."
[mika - 10 - _]
Yeah sure haha!
[mika - 03 - _]
Well it works out for me so, let's keep going.
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - festival_road_night - _]
[mika - 02 - _]
Let's see.... what's there to buy....
[sensei - _ - _]
"What about some Peroro merch?"
[mika - 00 - _]
mmmm....... she's not that simple...
[mika - 15 - _]
Seia is often stressing about this and that
[mika - 05 - _]
And her body is so weak she can hardly handle it.
[mika - 15 - _]
Maybe something that would help her relax?
[mika - 02 - _]
Like a spa trip!
[sensei - _ - _]
"That sounds nice"
[mika - 03 - _]
They are! You gotta try it!
[mika - 05 - _]
But with how she is, I wonder if she'd agree to go?
[sensei - _ - _]
"Won't know until you try right?"
[mika - 10 - _]
So true bestie!
[clear - _ - _]
[mika - 09 - _]
What's all that commotion about?
[mika - 02 - _]
Let's go check it out!
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - christmas_square - _]
[mika - 03 - _]
Wow look at that tree! 
[mika - 02 - _]
It's really pretty...
[mika - 23 - _]
....your next line will be 'not as pretty as you'....
[sensei - _ - _]
"!?"
[mika - 10 - _]
Haha you're gonna have to try harder than that Sensei...!
[loud_man - _ - _]
Come one, come all! 
[loud_man - _ - _]
Celebrate the new year here in town square!
[loud_man - _ - _]
We've got gifts, food, games, food games, anything you want!
[mika - 09 - _]
Oh wow...
[mika - 02 - _]
Looks like a festival out here!
[sensei - _ - _]
"Wanna check it out? Could be fun."
[mika - 03 - _]
Yeah! And we might find something for Seia-chan!
[clear - _ - _]

[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
You there! Yes you, the teacher looking fella!
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
Come try your hand at the Hammer Down challenge!
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
You could win this exclusive New Years Peroro hairpin for your lovely lady!
[sensei - _ - _]
"Challenge accepted!"
[mika - 10 - _]
Wooo~! Go Sensei~!
[sensei - _ - _]
(Smash that button with all your might!)
[none - _ - _]
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
Aww! So close! Good try though!
[sensei - _ - _]
"I can't do it... I'm not... strong enough..."
[mika - 10 - _]
You're still incredible Sensei!
[mika - 09 - _]
Can I try?
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
Uh, sure! Here do your best!
[mika - 10 - _]
Ok! Here I go!

[mika - 04 - _]
Oops...
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
Wha- what strength......
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
You completely destroyed the machine...
[sensei - _ - _]
"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!!!"
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
Well we have a winner!!!
[hammer_booth_man - _ - _]
Here's your prize miss, the super limited edition New Years Peroro Hairpin!!!
[mika - 10 - _]
Sensei!! Look I won!!!
[sensei - _ - _]
"...you sure did"
[none - _ - _]
[sensei - _ - _]
"Should be almost time..."
[mika - 04 - _]
Already!?
[mika - 08 - _]
But, I got so distracted with the festival...
[mika - 08 - _]
Ugh... what do I do...
[mika - 15 - _]
I can't believe the year is already over!
[sensei - _ - _]
"Uhm it's-"
[mika - 02 - _]
We were supposed to find a gift for Seia-chan
[mika - 06 - _]
And I would have surprised her with the whole thing
[mika - 07 - _]
But I completely messed it up!
[mika - 01 - _]
That does it, when the new year comes I'm setting new goals!
[mika - 05 - _]
I want to be more attentive, more proactive...
[mika - 02 - _]
I know I often get caught up in my own thing...
[sensei - _ - _]
"Mika--"
[mika - 15 - _]
I want to see things for what they are
[mika - 15 - _]
And be aware of what's happening...
[mika - 07 - _]
Plus there's a lot of things I regretted this year...
[mika - 08 - _]
...and I couldn't find Seia-chan anything worthwhile
[clear - _ - _]
[??? - _ - _]
Maybe you should start now then.
[mika - 04 - _]
Wha-
[seia - 00 - move_right_async]
[mika - 11 - move_left_async]
Seia-chan?
[seia - 02 - _]
It's not even time yet...
[mika - 17 - _]
[seia - 04 - _]
I heard what was going on-----
[mika - 10 - move_right]
SEIA-CHAAAAAN~
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - hug - _]
[seia - _ - _]
Hey! What are you...
[mika - _ - _]
Seia-chan!! I'm so glad you're here!!!!
[mika - _ - _]
How did you know?
[mika - _ - _]
Did you read my mind or something!?
[seia - _ - _]
No!
[seia - _ - _]
Ugh...
[seia - _ - _]
Come on, put me down already!
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - festival_night - _]
[seia - 00 - move_right]
[mika - 10 - move_left]
I thought I would mess this up again!
[mika - 15 - _]
Why are you here?
[seia - 06 - _]
*sigh* ...well you might have.
[seia - 02 - _]
But lucky for you, Sensei texted me.
[seia - 04 - _]
Knowing you I figured it'd be best to not wait.
[mika - 10 - _]
Wow! Sensei you're amazing!
[mika - 15 - _]
Well, Seia-chan...
[mika - 02 - _]
I wanted to use this new years as a way to show you my thanks.
[mika - 03 - _]
For all the help you've given me..
[mika - 15 - _]
Even if you are annoying when you do it...
[mika - 03 - _]
I'm really glad to have you as a friend!
[seia - 06 - _]
Geez when did you become so sappy.
[seia - 02 - _]
.....well
[seia - 03 - _]
I'm glad too.
[mika - 10 - _]
Oh yeah!! I got you this gift it's a uh...
[mika - 15 - _]
Super limited edition... New Years Peroro hairpin....
[seia - 08 - _]
Well well, it's something... 
[clear - _ - _]
[seia - 02 - _]
How does it look?
[mika - 10 - _]
Haha you look like a little kid!
[mika - 03 - _]
But I love it, you look great!
[seia - 06 - _]
Thanks....
[seia - 03 - _]
I'll hang on to it then...
[sensei - _ - _]
"Isn't that great Mika"
[mika - 10 - _]
Wonderful!!
[mika - 15 - _]
Thank you, Sensei, just when I think you've done too much you do even more.
[sensei - _ - _]
"Just doing my part is all"
[clear - _ - _]
[sensei - _ - _]
"Now how about we enjoy the ONE cake we brought?"
[seia - 05 - _]
hm...?
[mika - 10 - _]
GEEZ! Will you let that go!
[clear - _ - _]
[bg - black_screen - _]
[_ - _ - _]
(And so, Mika, Seia, and I enjoyed some cake while counting down to new years.)
[_ - _ - _]
(And spent the rest of the night enjoying the festival.)

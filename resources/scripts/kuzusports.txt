Ah Sensei....
[delay - _ - 0.5]
[kuzunoha - 01 - _]
You're finally awake....
[_ - _ - _]
(Kuzunoha sat there in the lounge on a giant bean bag chair watching TV)
[Commentator - _ - _]
"We'll be back right after this commercial break!"
[kuzunoha - 02 - _]
Have you seen this....?
[kuzunoha - 01 - _]
Apparently it's called a "ball game"
[sensei - _ - _]
"Yeah it's a popular competitive sport."
[kuzunoha - 03 - _]
A competitive sport you say...?
[kuzunoha - 05 - _]
I see... so it's a type battle yes?
[kuzunoha - 05 - _]
They are meant to pit their bodies and minds to this deadly bout of strength?
[sensei - _ - _]
"Well... I wouldn't say deadly..."
[kuzunoha - 03 - _]
How interesting..... so what is on the line?
[kuzunoha - 01 - _]
Is it the rights to some lord's land perhaps?
[kuzunoha - 04 - _]
Or maybe those defeated will be absorbed into the victors territory?
[kuzunoha - 03 - _]
By the way where are the "Tigers" I keep hearing about? I only see the humans playing...?
[sensei - _ - _]
"Uhh no nothing like that..."
"They just play for fun."
[kuzunoha - 06 - _]
For fun huh....?
[kuzunoha - 05 - _]
My my how wonderful... to think they would battle to the death for nothing more than entertainment!
[sensei - _ - _]
"No one's dying!"
[Commentator - _ - _]
"Aaaand we're back!"
[kuzunoha - 04 - _]
Oh the battle has returned.... what great timing. Won't you join me?
[Commentator - _ - _]
"It's the bottom of the 9th, bases are loaded... will the Tigers take it home!?"
[kuzunoha - 03 - _]
Sensei look, it seems the decisive moment is upon us!
[Commentator - _ - _]
"On the plate is an Ace among the masses, what will he throw to close out this game?"
[kuzunoha - 06 - _]
It seems they're preparing to attack now...!
[Commentator - _ - _]
"Oh that's a strike... the Tigers just need one clean hit and they can win!"
[sensei - _ - _]
"I'm starting to sweat here...."
[kuzunoha - 01 - _]
Let's take a bath later then.... oh look here comes another attack!
[Commentator - _ - _]
"ANOTHER STRIKE!"
[kuzunoha - 01 - _]
The vanguard seems to be in a bind, luckily their ally has so much armor!
[Commentator - _ - _]
"It all comes down to this! Here comes the pitch.....!"

[sfx - baseball_hit_cheer - _]
[Commentator - _ - _]
"IT'S A HIT! A CLEAN HIT!"
[kuzunoha - 03 - _]
Marvelous, that child hit it!
[kuzunoha - 00 - _]
They're all in a frenzy... Sensei what happens next?
[sensei - _ - _]
"They run home"
[kuzunoha - 02 - _]
Home...? What about the soldiers left alive?
[sensei - _ - _]
"Again no one's dying!"
[kuzunoha - 01 - _]
I see... so after they all come back "home".... victory is declared?
[sensei - _ - _]
"You could say that"
[kuzunoha - 03 - _]
I'm impressed, what a splendid show!

Tell me. For whom do you fight?
[beatrice - _ - _]
Hmph! How very glib. And do you believe in Kivotos? Kivotos's unity is forged of falsehoods. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
Its academy-districts are built on deceit. And its faith is an instrument of deception.
[beatrice - _ - _]
It is naught but a cobweb of lies. To believe in Kivotos is to believe in nothing. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
In Kivotos, the citizens often summon students to fight in their stead--though your comrades only rarely respond in kind. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
Which is strange, is it not?
[beatrice - _ - _]
Is the "Federal Student Council" otherwise engaged? I was given to understand they were your protectors. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
If you truly believe them your guardians, why do you not repeat the trick that served you so well in D.U., and call them down? 
[beatrice - _ - _]
They will answer--so long as you lavish them with pyroxenes and gorge them on credits. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
Your "students" are no different than that of gematra's--mimeses every one. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
Accept but this, and you will see how Kivotos's faith is bleeding the land dry.
[beatrice - _ - _]
Nor is this unknown to your masters. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
Which prompts the question: Why do they cling to these false entities? What drives even men of learning--even the great Student Council President--to grovel at their feet? 
[beatrice - _ - _]
The answer? 
[bg - bitch2 - none]
[bgm - 48_Verse - _]
[beatrice - _ - _]
Your masters lack the strength to do otherwise! 
[beatrice - _ - _]
For the world of man to mean anything, man must own the world. To this end, he hath fought ever to raise himself through conflict--to grow rich through conquest. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
And when the dust of battle settles, is it ever the strong who dictate the fate of the weak.
[beatrice - _ - _]
Knowing this, but a single path is open to the impotent ruler--that of false worship. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
A path which leads to enervation and death. 
[beatrice - _ - _]
Only a woman of power can rightly steer the course of civilization.
[beatrice - _ - _]
And in this land of creeping mendacity, that one truth will prove its salvation.
[bg - bitch - none]
[bgm - 48_Chorus - _]
[beatrice - _ - _]
Come, Sensei of Kivotos, face me! Your defeat shall serve as proof of my readiness to rule! 
[beatrice - _ - _]
It is only right that I should take your realm. For none among you has the power to stop me!

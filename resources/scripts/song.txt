Why you callin' at 11:30
[mika - 06 - none]
When you only wanna do me dirty? (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
[mika - 03 - none]
But I hit right back
'Cause you got that-that, yeah
[mika - 02 - none]
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
[mika - 05 - none]
But you never wanna be each others' (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
[mika - 06 - none]
I say don't look back
But I go right back, yeah

[mika - 11 - none]
All of a sudden, I'm hypnotized
[mika - 15 - none]
You're the one that I can't deny
[mika - 06 - none]
Every time that I say I'm gonna walk away

[mika - 22 - none]
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
[mika - 10 - none]
Now, I don't wanna fight this (No)
[mika - 26 - none]
You know how to just make me want
[mika - 11 - none]
You turn me on like a light switch
[mika - 22 - none]
When you're movin' your body around and around
[mika - 07 - none]
You got me in a tight grip (Yeah)
[mika - 06 - none]
You know how to just make me want you...
[mika - 10 - none]
Baby
